## 📘 Practice 1 — Logistic Regression (Bank Dataset)
 datasource:(/kaggle/input/bank-marketing-dataset")
    
**Goal:**  
Predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit using **Logistic Regression**.

**Dataset:**  
Bank Marketing Dataset (from Kaggle)

**Main Steps:**
- Data Cleaning & Encoding with `pd.get_dummies()`
- Train/Test Split
- Model Training using `LogisticRegression`
- Hyperparameter Tuning with `GridSearchCV`
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score)

**Results:**  
✅ Accuracy improved from **0.78 → 0.81** after tuning.
